# Symbolic-Simplification (Racket)

A recursive program that simplifies symbolic mathematical expressions
using abstract syntax trees and fixed-point iteration.

Features:
- Canonicalization of expressions
- Pattern matching with Racket's `match`
- Recursive simplification until stable form
- Handles arithmetic identities and like-term reduction
